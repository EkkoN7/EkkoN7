## Hello everyone üëã

- I'm passionate about developing security-focused programs. When I'm not diving into cybersecurity, you'll often find me crafting simple games using Pygame. I also love to explore and experiment with Machine Learning and AI, always looking for ways to integrate them for better, smarter applications. Plus, I collaborate with a friend on app development at **[HiveNex](https://github.com/HiveNex/HiveHub)** organization.
- All my projects are documented in my **[Portfolio Repository](https://github.com/EkkoN7/Portfolio)**. Feel free to explore them, and connect with me for more details or collaboration!
