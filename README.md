## Hello everyone 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on fundamental concepts in programming security tools. Besides this, I'm also building a simple game with Pygame and collaborating with a friend on Android apps within the **[HiveNex](https://github.com/HiveNex/HiveHub)** organization.
- 📚 All my projects are documented in my **[Portfolio Repository](https://github.com/EkkoN7/Portfolio)**. Feel free to explore them, and connect with me for more details or collaboration!
- 📫 You can reach me at: [denis.durban@outlook.de](mailto:denis.durban@outlook.de)
