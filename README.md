## Hello everyone 👋

- Passionate about cybersecurity, I build tools to understand the inner workings of code. I also enjoy developing games and exploring AI applications.
- All my projects are documented in my **[Portfolio Repository](https://github.com/EkkoN7/Portfolio)**. Feel free to explore them, and connect with me for more details or collaboration!
- You can reach me at: [denis.durban@outlook.de](mailto:denis.durban@outlook.de)
